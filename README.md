# Pathfinding

### *This is a work in progress* 

Made using Pygame module in python to create an intuitive pathfinding algorithm visualization.


My aim is to add different algorithms to this visualisation program. My first algorithm is A*.
Click where the start node and end node is. Draw the obstacles and create your own map.

**Keybinds** 

- Right Click to erase tile colour
- 'a' to start finding the shortest route using A* algorithm
- 'd' to start Dijkstra's algorithm (haven't implemented this algorithm yet)
- 'c' to clear the board

### To do 
- [x] Add A* algorithm
- [ ] Create menu to show controls and available algorithms
- [ ] Add Dijkstra's algorithm
