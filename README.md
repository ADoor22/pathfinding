# Pathfinding

Made using Pygame module in python to create an intuitive pathfinding algorithm visualization.

Click where the start node and end node is. Draw the obstacles and create your own map.

**Keybinds** 

- Right Click to erase tile colour
- 'a' to start finding the shortest route using A* algorithm
- 'd' to start Dijkstra's algorithm (haven't implemented this algorithm yet)
- 'c' to clear the board

### To do 
- [x] Add A* algorithm
- [x] Add Dijkstra's algorithm
- [ ] Create menu to show controls and available algorithms
